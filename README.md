# About this project
Build a simple React app that displays a table view of the products in "products.json". 
The table should be sortable by column, and include a search bar that filters the table elements on every key stroke.

Example search functionality:

- When the search bar is empty, all products are displayed.
- When the user types "sink", the table filters to just display the sink unit.
- When the user types "HWR16-03", the table just shows the product with that code.
